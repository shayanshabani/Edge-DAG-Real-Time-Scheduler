# Real-Time Scheduling of Dependent Tasks in Edge Computing Environments: Project Report

## 1. Problem Definition and Approach

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Edge computing environments require efficient scheduling of complex, interdependent tasks to meet real-time constraints while optimizing energy consumption and Quality of Service (QoS). The challenge lies in scheduling task graphs (Directed Acyclic Graphs - DAGs) across heterogeneous edge devices with varying computational capabilities, power consumption characteristics, and communication delays.

### 1.2 Task Model

Tasks are modeled as a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** where:
- **Nodes** represent computational tasks with specific resource requirements
- **Edges** represent data dependencies between tasks
- Each task has computational cost (MIPS required) and data transfer requirements
- Tasks must be executed in dependency order (precedence constraints)

### 1.3 CPOP Algorithm Overview

The **Critical Path on a Processor (CPOP)** algorithm is a list-based heuristic scheduling algorithm that works in two phases:

1. **Priority Assignment Phase**: 
   - Calculates upward rank for each task using the formula:
   $$\text{rank}_u(n_i) = \overline{w_i} + \max_{n_j \in \text{succ}(n_i)} (\overline{c_{i,j}} + \text{rank}_u(n_j))$$
   - Where $\overline{w_i}$ is average computation time and $\overline{c_{i,j}}$ is average communication time

2. **Task Selection and Assignment Phase**:
   - Tasks are sorted by priority (descending upward rank)
   - Each task is assigned to the processor that minimizes its Earliest Finish Time (EFT)

### 1.4 Edge Computing Environment Model

The edge environment consists of:
- **Heterogeneous edge devices** with different processing capabilities (MIPS), cores, power consumption profiles
- **Communication network** with varying delays and bandwidth between devices
- **Energy model** considering both idle and active power consumption
- **QoS metrics** based on deadline satisfaction and load balancing

## 2. Code Architecture and Implementation

### 2.2 Core Algorithm Implementation

The CPOP implementation follows these steps:

1. **Initialization**: Reset all tasks and devices to clean state
2. **Rank Calculation**: Compute upward rank for priority assignment
3. **Task Sorting**: Order tasks by decreasing priority
4. **Scheduling Loop**: For each task, find device with minimum EFT
5. **Result Calculation**: Compute makespan, energy, and QoS metrics

## 3. Results Analysis and Interpretation

- **Cores**: 2-4 cores per device
- **Power Consumption**: 10.3-18.2 W (idle) to 60.5-97.1 W (maximum)
- **Bandwidth**: 54.0-97.5 MB/s (network capabilities)

### 3.2 Performance Metrics Analysis

#### 3.2.1 Makespan Analysis

**DAG with 10 edges:**
- Makespan increases linearly with task count: 4.11s (100 tasks) â†’ 15.30s (500 tasks)
- Growth rate: ~0.022s per additional task
- Indicates good scalability for sparse DAGs

**DAG with 20 edges:**
- Similar performance to 10 edges for most configurations
- Slight increase for 100 tasks (5.92s vs 4.11s) due to increased dependencies

**DAG with 30 edges:**
- Notable increase for smaller task sets (100 tasks: 9.23s)
- Converges to similar performance for larger task sets
- Suggests dependency bottlenecks in dense DAGs with fewer tasks

#### 3.2.2 Energy Consumption Analysis

**Energy scaling pattern:**
- Nearly linear increase with task count across all configurations
- 100 tasks: ~640-660 J
- 500 tasks: ~3,200-3,220 J
- Energy efficiency: ~6.4 J per task (consistent across scales)

**Edge density impact:**
- Minimal variation in total energy consumption
- Slight fluctuations due to different task-to-device mappings
- CPOP's EFT heuristic maintains energy efficiency

#### 3.2.3 Quality of Service (QoS) Analysis

**Excellent QoS performance:**
- 97.88% - 100.00% QoS across all configurations
- Higher edge density slightly reduces QoS for smaller task sets
- QoS improvement with larger task sets (better load distribution)

**QoS components:**
- **Deadline satisfaction**: Tasks complete within flexible deadlines
- **Load balancing**: Even distribution across devices prevents bottlenecks
