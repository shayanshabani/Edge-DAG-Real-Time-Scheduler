# üö¶ Comparative Analysis of CPOP and PSO for DAG Task Scheduling in Edge Computing

<div align="center">



### A comprehensive simulation toolkit for scheduling dependent workflows on heterogeneous edge infrastructure. This project implements and contrasts a classic heuristic (CPOP) with a metaheuristic (PSO) to explore the trade-offs between makespan, energy, and Quality of Service.

## üåü Project Overview

In edge computing, efficiently scheduling complex workflows‚Äîrepresented as **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)**‚Äîis a critical challenge. The goal is to assign computational tasks to a diverse set of edge devices (VMs) to optimize for multiple, often conflicting, objectives.

This project provides a robust, simulation-based framework to tackle this problem by implementing and evaluating two distinct scheduling philosophies:

1.  **CPOP (Critical-Path On a Processor):** A fast, deterministic heuristic that prioritizes minimizing the longest execution path in the workflow.
2.  **PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization):** A powerful metaheuristic that explores a vast solution space to co-optimize for a blend of objectives, including **makespan**, **energy consumption**, and **Quality of Service (QoS)**.

Our findings reveal a crucial trade-off: the "best" algorithm is entirely dependent on the specific performance goals of the edge application.

## üìä Key Findings at a Glance

Our experiments, conducted using the **CloudSimPlus** framework, yielded a nuanced and insightful comparison. The choice of the "best" algorithm is not straightforward and depends entirely on the optimization goal.

| Metric | CPOP (Heuristic) | PSO (Metaheuristic) | Insight |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Makespan** (Speed) | üèÜ **Winner** | Slower | CPOP's rigid, speed-focused strategy is superior for raw completion time. |
| **Energy Consumption** | Higher | üèÜ **Winner** | PSO intelligently assigns tasks to power-efficient VMs, even if they are slower. |
| **Quality of Service (QoS)** | Lower | üèÜ **Winner** | PSO excels at finding balanced solutions that improve load distribution and stability. |
| **Scheduling Overhead** | ‚ö° **Negligible** | High | CPOP is near-instantaneous, while PSO's iterative search is computationally expensive. |

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Design

The project is built with a modular and extensible architecture, making it ideal for future research and experimentation.

-   **`Core Models`**: `Task.java` and `DAGGenerator.java` define the fundamental workflow structures and procedurally generate random DAGs for testing.
-   **`EdgeEnvironment.java`**: Configures the CloudSimPlus simulation, creating hosts and a heterogeneous pool of VMs to model the edge infrastructure.
-   **`Scheduler Implementations`**: The heart of the project.
    -   `CPOPScheduler.java`: Implements the rank calculation, critical path identification, and task-to-VM mapping logic for the CPOP heuristic.
    -   `PSOScheduler.java`: Implements the swarm initialization, iterative fitness evaluation, and particle update loop for the PSO metaheuristic.
-   **`EdgeSchedulingSimulation.java`**: The main driver that orchestrates the experiments‚Äîrunning both schedulers on a common DAG, launching the simulations, and aggregating the results for comparison.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
*   Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher
*   Apache Maven

### Installation & Execution

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/edge-dag-scheduling.git
    cd edge-dag-scheduling
    ```

2.  **Build the project using Maven:**
    This command will download all dependencies (like CloudSimPlus) and compile the source code.
    ```bash
    mvn clean package
    ```

3.  **Run the simulation:**
    Execute the packaged JAR file to run the full comparative simulation.
    ```bash
    java -jar target/EdgeScheduling-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
    ```
    The console will output the progress and final results of the comparison.

## üß™ Extending This Project

This codebase is designed to be a foundation for further research. Here are some ideas:

-   **Tune PSO Parameters:** Conduct a sensitivity analysis on PSO's population size, inertia weight, and fitness function weights to see if its makespan performance can be improved.
-   **Develop a Hybrid Algorithm:** Create a new scheduler that uses CPOP to generate a high-quality initial solution for the PSO swarm. This could offer the best of both worlds!
-   **Implement Other Algorithms:** Add other classic heuristics (e.g., HEFT) or metaheuristics (e.g., Genetic Algorithm, Ant Colony Optimization) for a broader comparison.
-   **Introduce Realistic Network Models:** Enhance `EdgeEnvironment.java` to simulate network latency and bandwidth constraints between different edge locations.
